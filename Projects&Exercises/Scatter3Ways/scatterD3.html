// 1) Select your `body` and append a `div` element in which you'll render your content. To do this, you'll use the `d3.select()` method, and then the `.append()` method to append your element to your selection.
// 2)  Append a new `p` element to the `div` you just created, and use the `.text()` method to set the text to "My First D3 Scatter"
// How this would look if you defined each separately:
// p_tag = div.append('p')
// text = p_tag.text('My First D3 Scatter')
// Saming thing using chaining: 
// 3)  Append a container `svg` to your `div` element in which you'll place your circles     
// - Set your svg's `width` to 300, and `height` to `400` 
// 4) Append 3 `circle` elements inside of your `<svg>` (one at a time), setting the properties for each one. We'll improve on this process later: 
// - `cx`: How far to move the circle in the `x` direction (right). Should be 100, 150, and 200. 
// - `cy`: How for to move the circle in the `y` direction (down from the top). Should be 100, 150, and 200. 
// - 'r': circle's radius. Should be 10, 15, and 20.
