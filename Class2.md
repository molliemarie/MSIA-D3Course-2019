# Welcome to Day Two! :D

# Agenda:

- questions?
- css, html, javascript review
- debugging using the console,  `console.log()`, global variables, etc.
- finish our first Scatter Plot - add interactions!
- post to bl.ocks
- first line chart
- think about the D3 blueprint
- discuss readings and videos from last class
- end of day discussion

## Discussion: Review of CSS, HTML, Javascript

Let's talk about the different components of a webpage - [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp), [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp), and [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). 

**What does each do?**

Let's examine the code we've already written, find where each of the three exist, and talk about what they're doing.

## Add styling and interactions to our scatter plot

First, we will finish up our static scatter plot by:
  - loading in our data with `d3.csv`
  - formatting our x axis
  - adding gridlines and other stylings
  - adding a title
  
 Instructions [here](Projects&Exercises/FirstCompleteScatter/README.md) - scroll down to **"Day Two"**.
  
Then, we'll move on to adding interactions to our plot, which will include
  - hover interactions
  - creating buttons
  - updating data shown
  - utilizing `transition`, `duration`, and `ease`
  
Instructions [here](Projects&Exercises/FirstCompleteScatter/scatterWithInteractions.md).

## Post to bl.ocks

Now, we'll follow [these instructions](TechnicalSetup/blocks.md) to add our new visualizations to bl.ocks.org

## Your first D3.js line chart!

We will follow [these instructions](Projects&Exercises/FirstCompleteScatter/addingALine.md) to build off our scatter plot to create your first d3.js line chart.

## Discussion / Activity: d3.s Blueprint

All d3 plots start similarly. I'll give you some time to think about what these components are. We will discuss as a class and then you will create your own blueprint file.

## Discussion: End of Day Q&A

How was the first day? What questions do you have so far?

What we'll do next class:

- go over any questions
- general update pattern
- first bar chart

**Before Next Class**

If you're having trouble with HTML, CSS, or Javascript basics, I would recommend doing the corresponding tutorial before next class.
